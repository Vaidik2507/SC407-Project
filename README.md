Purpose:
To introduce an innovative approach addressing climate change through a Carbon Emission-based Toll Taxation System utilizing OBD-II sensor data.

Objective:
Mitigate CO2 emissions in personal transportation by utilizing precise OBD-II sensor data.

Problem Statement:
The Global Challenge of Climate Change - The pressing global challenge of climate change necessitates a comprehensive understanding of the environmental impact of individual actions, particularly in the domain of personal transportation.
Transportation Emissions - Transportation accounts for a substantial portion of global CO2 emissions, making it a major contributor to climate change. The imperative to bridge the awareness-action gap is undeniable.

Addressing the Awareness Gap:
Lack of Understanding - Despite increasing global awareness, there remains a significant lack of understanding among individuals regarding the carbon footprint generated by their daily transportation choices.
Empowering Drivers - Feedback from OBD-II sensors aims to empower drivers with insights for improvement, enhancing environmental consciousness.

Implementing the Toll Tax Management System:
Emission Tax Calculation ->
1. Incentivizing Eco-friendly Behavior - The proposed system introduces an emission tax that is calculated based on the carbon emissions produced by a vehicle during a particular trip.Financial Incentive: By adding this emission tax to the regular toll tax, vehicles that produce higher carbon emissions during a trip will be charged a higher overall toll, creating a financial incentive for drivers to adopt eco-friendly driving practices.
2. Financial Incentive - By adding this emission tax to the regular toll tax, vehicles that produce higher carbon emissions during a trip will be charged a higher overall toll, creating a financial incentive for drivers to adopt eco-friendly driving practices.
Dynamic Toll Tax Adjustment ->
1. Real-time Calculation - The emission tax amount is dynamically adjusted based on vehicle emissions, aiming to encourage low-emission vehicles and discourage high-emission ones.
2. Financial Motivation - The system creates a financial motivation for individuals to opt for lower-emission transportation choices, promoting immediate emission reductions and driving long-term behavioral changes.

Numerical Results and Validation:
Emissions Estimates - The algorithm generated emissions estimates ranging from 170-230 grams per kilometer, offering a refinement due to their basis on real-time engine and vehicle parameters.
Validation - The robustness and reliability of the algorithm underscore its potential for accurately estimating emissions from vehicles across diverse driving conditions and vehicle types..

Future Scope and Conclusion:
Future Development - Further research and development are necessary to address potential challenges and enhance the system's accuracy and effectiveness.
Tackling Climate Change - The proposed Carbon Emission-based Toll Taxation System combines technological advancements and policy measures into an integrated solution that promotes sustainable transportation practices and reduces vehicular emissions contributing to climate change.
